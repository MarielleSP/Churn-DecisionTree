## Project Summary

*Churn* is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. Loss of customers generally results in loss of profit for a business. In contrast, "[increasing customer retention rates by 5\% increases profits by 25\% to 95\%.](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers)" A model that identifies customers who are likely to churn could enable early intervention to prevent loss of business.
