## Project Summary

*Churn* is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. Loss of customers generally results in loss of profit for a business. In contrast, "[increasing customer retention rates by 5\% increases profits by 25\% to 95\%.](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers)" A model that identifies customers who are likely to churn could enable early intervention to prevent loss of business. 

This study uses data on [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), which has 19 features describing customer demographics, subscription services, and account information. By using univariate analysis of categorical and continuous data to eliminate features that do not correlate to churn, the number of features is reduced to 8. These features are used to build a decision tree.
